# WinObjEx64
## Windows Object Explorer 64-bit

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hfiref0x/WinObjEx64/master/Screenshots/MainWindow.png" width="600" />

WinObjEx64 is an advanced utility that lets you explore the Windows Object Manager namespace. For certain object types, you can double-click on it or use the "Properties..." toolbar button to get more information, such as description, attributes, resource usage etc. WinObjEx64 let you view and edit object-related security information if you have required access rights.

# System Requirements

WinObjEx64 does not require administrative privileges. However administrative privilege is required to view much of the namespace and to edit object-related security information.

WinObjEx64 works only on the following x64 Windows: Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10, including Server variants.

1. This feature require driver support enabled, see "Driver support" part below.
2. This may require administrator privileges.
3. Most of additional Windows internals-specific features however will be unavailable due to obvious reasons.
4. Some named pipes may require administrator privileges to access.

### Driver support

WinObjEx64 supports two types of driver helpers:

1. Helper for read-only access to the kernel memory. Default version uses Kernel Local Debugging Driver (KLDBGDRV) from WinDbg. In order to use it (and thus enable all the above features) Windows must be booted in the debug mode (bcdedit -debug on) and WinObjEx64 must be run with administrator privileges. If you are using WinObjEx64 version with custom helper driver - Windows debug mode is not required. There are exist several drivers that can be used as helpers for WinObjEx64, by default it has only WinDbg type built-in.
2. Helper to access object handles. WinObjEx64 (any variant) support Process Explorer driver of version 1.5.2 to open process/threads. To enable this just load Process Explorer with administrator privileges simultaneously with WinObjEx64.

All driver helpers require WinObjEx64 to be run with administrative privileges.
